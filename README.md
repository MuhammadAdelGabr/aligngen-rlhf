AlignGen: Human-Aligned Text-to-Image Generation with RLHF and Efficient Inference

Developed AlignGen, a multimodal generative AI framework that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve image quality and alignment with user preferences. Built a synthetic data generation pipeline that boosted downstream vision task accuracy by 18%. Optimized inference with ONNX and TensorRT, achieving 3Ã— faster generation speeds for on-premises deployment.
