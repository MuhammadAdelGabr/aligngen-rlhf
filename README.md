AlignGen: Human-Aligned Text-to-Image Generation with RLHF and Efficient Inference

Developed AlignGen, a multimodal generative AI framework that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion on domain-specific datasets with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve alignment and image quality. Built a synthetic data generation pipeline that enhanced downstream vision task accuracy by 18%. Optimized inference with ONNX and TensorRT, achieving 3Ã— faster generation speeds for efficient on-premises deployment.
